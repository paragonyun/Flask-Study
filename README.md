- It is used for add more actions of function without revising  
- It is little bit complicated but very useful!  

**2. Terminal Issues**  
- Windows Terminal somtimes raise error because Using '' Not "  "  :confused:    
- Somtimes.. we don't need "SPACE BAR"    
- We can easily run codes with cmd file! (You should not use space bar...!)
  
**3. Making Envrionments**  
- It is VERY USEFUL for developers when each project require different version of libraries  
- We can be less worried about version conflict or conflict between project !!  
- and I think it is more easier to connect with Git..!
