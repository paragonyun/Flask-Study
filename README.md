# Flask Study and Envrionment :earth_asia:
I refer to [Jump to Flask](https://wikidocs.net/book/4542)   
Window  
VS Code  
Git Bash  
Python (So Obviously)

# What I learned from this book (Python and Terminal Basic) :facepunch:
**1. @decorator function of python**  
- It is used for add more actions of function without revising  
- It is little bit complicated but very useful!  

**2. Terminal Issues**  
- Windows Terminal somtimes raise error because Using '' Not "  "  :confused:    
- Somtimes.. we don't need "SPACE BAR"    
- We can easily run codes with cmd file! (You should not use space bar...!)
  
**3. Making Envrionments**  
- It is VERY USEFUL for developers when each project require different version of libraries  
- We can be less worried about version conflict or conflict between project !!  
- and I think it is more easier to connect with Git..!  

# What I learned from this book (Flask) :blue_book:  
- We have to run flask  _at project directory_

- How to use *_Subquery_*
  - For joining complicated relationships
```python
sub_query = db.session.query(Answer.question_id, Answer.content, User.username)\
            .join(User, Answer.user_id == User.id).subquery()

Question.query.outerjoin(sub_query, sub_query.c.question_id == Question.id).distinct()
```

## **9.14**
- Using **config file** for more safe environment!!
- To generate **Complex Secret KEY**, use codes below in Terminal!!
```Terminal
python -c "import os; print(os.urandom(16))"

<br>

# What I leaned from this book (Web and Server!) :computer:
## **9.14** (long time... no... see...)
- Web Browser request a **"Static Page"** to server!
  - It means `.js`, `.png`, `.css` , `.html`.. etc..
- Web Browser also request a **"Dynamic Page"**
  - It means changes continuously! like question list that is connected with DB!!
- When Browser request Dynamic Page, we need **Web Server and "WSGI(위스키)[=WSGI미들웨어, WSGI컨테이너]" Server!!**
  - _**Web Server calls WSGI Server and WSGI Server calls python programs!!**_
  - Web Server -> WSGI Server -> Python Programs!

- WSGI Server calls WSGI Application(like django.. FLASK!)

- If the function is different, it is better to seperate them by module. It will be easier to maintain projects!! 

# What I want to KNOW :grey_question:
- I don't know why I get messages like _""GET /static/bootstrap.min.css HTTP/1.1" 304 -"_ or _""GET /static/style.css HTTP/1.1" 304 -"_
- (8.22) I can not see "계정생성" and "로그인" in my page... I think made some typo.. 
  - (8.30) I finally find why I could not SEE that buttons... It was because the size of Window!!!!!!!! ... :(
